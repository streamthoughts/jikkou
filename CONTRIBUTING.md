# Found a bug ?

If you found a bug in the source code you can help us by submitting an issue or even a Pull Request to our GitHub Repository.

# Got a new idea ?

Any new feature propositions are always appreciated. Ideas are what keep this project working. The first step is to open an issue and describe your proposal so that it can be discussed. If you changes are small you can directlty proposed a Pull Request that will be reviewed before being merged.

# Coding Guidelines

 * Any code changes must include some unit tests that cover the new functionality or the bugfix.
 * Frequently rebase your works to ease the Pull Request merging.
