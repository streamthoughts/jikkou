<h2 class="mb-5">Why Jikkou?</h2>

[Jikkou](https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou) is an open-source tool to help you automate the
management of the configurations that live on your [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) clusters.
It was developed by Kafka ❤️ to make daily operations on an Apache Kafka cluster simpler for both **developers** and **administrators**.

It can efficiently manage configuration changes for **Topics**, **ACLs**, **Quotas** and more with the use of **_resource specification files_**.
It is also applicable to quickly replicate the configuration of a production cluster to another with a few command lines or to initialize a new cluster for testing purpose.

_Resource specifications_ are standard [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files which are easy to create, version, share, and publish.
For this reason, Jikkou is usually used part of CI/CD pipelines allowing you to version and ship your Apache Kafka resources directly from Git (more on [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/)).
