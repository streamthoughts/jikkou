  How to contribute to Jikkou
---

Jikkou is an open source project and we love getting patches and contributions to make Jikkou and its docs even better.


## Contributing to Jikkou
The Jikkou project itself lives in https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou

## Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.

## Creating issues
Alternatively, if there’s something you’d like to see in Jikkou (or if you’ve found something that isn’t working the way you’d expect),
but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an [issue](https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/issues).
