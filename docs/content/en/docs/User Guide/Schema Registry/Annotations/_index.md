retrieved.

#### `schemaregistry.jikkou.io/normalize-schema`

This annotation can be used to normalize the schema on SchemaRegistry server side. Note, that Jikkou will attempt
to normalize AVRO and JSON schema.


See: [Confluent SchemaRegistry API Reference](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/develop/api.html#post--subjects-(string-%20subject)-versions)

#### `schemaregistry.jikkou.io/permanante-delete`

Used on: `schemaregistry.jikkou.io/v1beta2:SchemaRegistrySubject`

The annotation can be used to specify a hard delete of the subject, which removes all associated metadata including
the schema ID. The default is false. If the flag is not included, a soft delete is performed. You must perform a soft
delete first, then the hard delete.
