__Note: Jikkou is the project formerly known as **Kafka Specs**. Old versions of this project can still be found under that name.__

== Introduction

**https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou[Jikkou]** (jikk≈ç / ÂÆüË°å) is an open-source tool to help you automate the
management of the configurations that live on your https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/[Apache Kafka] clusters.
It was developed by Kafka ‚ù§Ô∏è to make daily operations on an Apache Kafka cluster simpler for both **developers** and **administrators**.

It can efficiently manage configuration changes for **Topics**, **ACLs**, **Quotas** and more with the use of **_resource specification files_**.
It is also applicable to quickly replicate the configuration of a production cluster to another with a few command lines or to initialize a new cluster for testing purpose.

=== The main usage scenarios

* Create new resource entities on an Apache Kafka cluster (i.e., _Topics_, _ACLs_, and _Quotas_).
* Update the configurations of existing resource entities.
* Delete resource entities which are not anymore managed.
* Describe all the configuration defined for Brokers.
* Describe all the configuration defined for _Topics_, _ACLs_, and _Quotas_.

=== Core features that make it awesome

* Simple command line interface (CLI) for end user.
* Simple Java API on top of the Kafka's  https://kafka.apache.org/30/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/Admin.html[Java AdminClient].
* Completely stateless and thus does not store any state (Basically: _Your kafka cluster is the state of Jikkou_).
* Pluggable validation rules to ensure that resources meet your requirement before being created or updated ona target cluster.
* Pluggable resource manager to extend Jikkou with cloud managed services for Apache Kafka which are supported out-of-the-box.
* Simple templating mechanism using [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) notation.

== Installation

Jikkou is available:

* As a zip/tar.gz package from https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/releases/tag/v0.12.2[GitHub Releases]
* As a fatJar available from https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/streamthoughts/jikkou/0.12.2/[Maven Central]
* As a docker image available from https://hub.docker.com/r/streamthoughts/jikkou[Docker Hub].
* As a Debian package from https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/releases/tag/v0.12.2[GitHub Releases]

```bash
wget https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/releases/download/v0.12.2/jikkou.deb
sudo dpkg -i jikkou.deb
```

NOTE: Jikkou will install itself in the directory :  `/opt/jikkou`

It is recommended to install the bash/zsh completion script `jikkou_completion`:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamthoughts/jikkou/master/jikkou_completion . jikkou_completion
```

or alternatively, run the following command for generation the completion script.

```
source <(jikkou generate-completion)
```

== Overview

It allows you to define the desired current state of your **Topics**, **ACLs**, or **Quotas**, using one or more YAML resource specification files :

kafka-topics.yml:::
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1
spec:
  topics:
  - name: 'my-first-topic-with-jikkou'
    partitions: 12
    replication_factor: 3
    configs:
      min.insync.replicas: 2
----

It will then take care of computing and applying the necessary changes directly to your cluster.

[source, bash]
----
$ jikkou --bootstrap-servers localhost:9092 topics apply \
    --file kafka-topics.yml \
    --yes
----

[source]
----
TASK [CREATE] Create a new topic my-first-topic-with-jikkou (partitions=12, replicas=3) - CHANGED **********************
----
[source, json]
----
{
  "changed" : true,
  "end" : 1634071489773,
  "resource" : {
    "name" : "my-first-topic-with-jikkou",
    "operation" : "ADD",
    "partitions" : {
      "after" : 12,
      "operation" : "ADD"
    },
    "replication_factor" : {
      "after" : 3,
      "operation" : "ADD"
    },
    "configs" : {
      "min.insync.replicas" : {
        "after" : "2",
        "operation" : "ADD"
      }
    }
  },
  "failed" : false,
  "status" : "CHANGED"
}
----
[source]
----
EXECUTION in 2s 661ms (DRY_RUN)
ok : 0, created : 1, altered : 0, deleted : 0 failed : 0
----

Most of the time, you will use Jikkou part of your CI/CD pipeline allowing you to version and ship your Apache Kafka resources directly from Git (more on https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/[GitOps])

Jikkou can be used with self-hosted Kafka, managed Kafka and Confluent Cloud.

NOTE: you can use the environment variable `JIKKOU_DEFAULT_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` for connection to the Kafka cluster (instead of the CLI arg `--bootstrap-servers`)
